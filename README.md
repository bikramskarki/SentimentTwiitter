# SentimentTwiitter
Twitter is a microblogging and social networking service in which users post and interact with messages known as tweets. It can be used to receive news, follow currently trending issue, follow high profile celebrities and information exchanges using Hashtags. Hashtags has widely been used to post tweets that allows users to apply users dynamic, user-generated tagging which makes it possible for others to find messages with specific content. The number of tweeter users are increasing, and this has generated huge amount of data. From these pools of billions of tweets, filtering them for a specific purpose plays a vital role. In this project, we have used Hadoop and MapReduce framework in single and multinode machines, and Decaying Window Algorithm to identify the most popular or trending tweets related to peopleâ€™s perception on climate change from the dataset. Our results show that fully distributed multinode cluster with one master and two salves is efficient and faster than one master and one slave by 8 secs and the popular trending hashtags are #climatechange and #climateaction.
